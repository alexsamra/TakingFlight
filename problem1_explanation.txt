We made it fair for each team by having one function that checks if any team can play to go through the teams in a random order
allowing each to have an equal chance to take the field if they have enough players.
We avoid multiple teams taking the field at once by only allowing one thread to check if a team can play at once and then locking the field if available.
The field is then only unlocked when the last player leaves the field.
This program works with any lengths of time but we thought that games lasting between 4-8 seconds was a good balance and having players arrive and 
take 0-59 seconds to recover allowed for there to be mostly time with enough players waiting but also time when there were not enough players for any game.
